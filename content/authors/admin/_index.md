I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), supervised by [Alina Oprea](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/alina/). I obtained my PhD from [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), where I was advised by Professor [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/). My primary area of research is privacy/security in machine learning at a broad level, with fine-grained topics exploring membership inference, user inference, LLMs/RAG systems.
